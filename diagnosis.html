        <p> Images like these can be found on most cat-nased websites, as they are important for knowing easily if your cat is underweight, overweight, or perfectly fine with no need to worry. If charts like these aren't helpful enough, you can also always ask your vet to weigh your cat after giving them your cats age and breed.</p>
